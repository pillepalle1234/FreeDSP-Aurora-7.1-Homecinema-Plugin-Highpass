The 7.1 Homecinema Plugin provided by Raphael (auverdion) has no High pass filter included for the subwoofer channel.
I needed one since my subwoofers are ported.

Raphael created this plugin for me where there is a highpass filter in the Subwoofer channel instead of a lowpass filter.

Furthermore all the filters (low Shelf, EQ, high Shelf, High pass) for the subwoofer channel are now applied after the summation.
See schematics for more infos on this.
